# ðŸ”¨ App Center build scripts for Xamarin ðŸ”¨

This repository contains shell scripts used in [App Center](http://appcenter.ms) for building Xamarin.Forms iOS and Android apps.

**TODO:**

* Add PowerShell scripts for UWP

## Environment variables

As well as a list of [pre-defined](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/build/custom/scripts/#app-center-variables) environment variables, [App Center](http://appcenter.ms) also allows you to declare custom environment variables. All scripts are using some sort of custom environment variable that is declared in the App Center build configuration.

## Project path

Typically, Xamarin.Forms project structure are structured like this:

* MyApp
  * MyApp
    * MyApp.csproj
    * MyApp.iOS
      * MyApp.iOS.csproj
    * MyApp.Droid
      * MyApp.Droid.csproj
    * MyApp.UWP
        * MyApp.UWP.csproj
* MyApp.sln

When App Center is cloning your repository your folder structure will become

* MyRepoName
  * MyApp
    * MyApp
    * MyApp.iOS
    * MyApp.Droid
    * MyApp.UWP
  * MyApp.sln

Which means when using `$APPCENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`, you will be at the `MyRepoName` level of your repository.
So if you want to manipulate your `Info.plist` file you have to call `$APPCENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/MyApp/MyApp.iOS/Info.plist`,
and if you want to manipulate your Android manifest you have to call `$APPCENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/MyApp/MyApp.Droid/Properties/AndroidManifest.xml`.
